To Setup Virtual Environment for python in a folder
We will name the folder as "venv"

Note - We do this thing so that we can install dependencies for this particular project in 
the environment of this project, rather than installing dependencies for this project globally.

Code 

python3 -m venv .venv   {To Setup the virtual environment}
source .venv/bin/activate   {To Activate the Virtual Environment}

Note - After Creating the Virtual Environment and installing all the dependencies in the environment.
We can create a .txt file which will have all the dependencies installed in this environment and as 
we install more dependencies they will get added up in the file.

*** To create the file, use command -> pip3 freeze nameOfFile.txt 

Note - To Run our Flask application we need to setup a few environment variables.
1. export FLASK_APP=application.py
2. export FLASK_ENV=development
This Setup we need to do again as after running one time these environment variables will go away.


To Enter Data into Database (If we use SQLALchemy for Flask)

Go inside Python commmand line in Terminal, by typing "Python3"

from application import db  (To import database from our application)
from application import Drink   (To import Drink class from our application)

db.create_all() [It will create a table to store data]

drink = Drink(name="Grape Soda", description="Tastes like grapes") 
[We creating an object name drink. As, inside SQL Alchemy we store data as Model or Object]

db.session.add(drink)   [This will add object drink to Database]
db.session.commit()     [To add object to database]

[To fetch drinks information from database]
Drink.query.all()
